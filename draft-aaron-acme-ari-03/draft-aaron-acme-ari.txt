Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Renewal Information
                            (ARI) Extension
                      draft-aaron-acme-ari-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies how an ACME server may provide suggestions to
   ACME clients as to when they should attempt to renew their
   certificates.  This allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and
   ensures clients do not make false assumptions about appropriate
   certificate renewal periods.

1.  Introduction

   Most ACME [RFC8555] clients today choose when to attempt to renew a
   certificate in one of three ways.  They may be configured to renew at
   a specific interval (e.g. via cron); they may parse the issued
   certificate to determine its expiration date and renew a specific
   amount of time before then; or they may parse the issued certificate
   and renew when some percentage of its validity period has passed.
   The first two techniques create significant barriers against the
   issuing CA changing certificate lifetimes.  All three techniques lead
   to load clustering for the issuing CA.

   Being able to indicate to the client a period in which the issuing CA
   suggests renewal would allow for dynamic smearing of load, enabling a
   CA to respond to exceptional circumstances.  For example, a CA could
   suggest that clients renew prior to a mass-revocation event to
   mitigate the impact of the revocation, or a CA could suggest that
   clients renew earlier than they normally would to reduce the size of
   an upcoming mass-renewal spike.

   This document specifies a mechanism by which ACME servers may provide
   suggested renewal windows to ACME clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extensions to the ACME Protocol: The "directory" Resource

   An ACME server which wishes to provide renewal information MUST
   include a new field, renewalInfo, in its directory object.

                      +=============+==============+
                      | Field       | URL in Value |
                      +=============+==============+
                      | renewalInfo | Renewal info |
                      +-------------+--------------+

       "website": "https://www.example.com/",
       "caaIdentities": ["example.com"],
       "externalAccountRequired": false
     }
   }

4.  Extensions to the ACME Protocol: The "renewalInfo" Resource

   The "renewalInfo" resource is a new resource type introduced to ACME
   protocol.  This new resource both allows clients to query the server
   for suggestions on when they should renew certificates, and allows
   clients to inform the server when they have completed renewal (or
   otherwise replaced the certificate to their satisfaction).

4.1.  Getting Renewal Information

   To request the suggested renewal information for a certificate, the
   client sends a GET request to a path under the server's renewalInfo
   URL.

   The full request URL is computed by concatenating the renewalInfo URL
   from the server's directory with a forward slash and the base64url-
   encoded [RFC4648] bytes of a DER-encoded CertID ASN.1 sequence
   [RFC6960].  Trailing '=' characters MUST be stripped.

   For example, to request renewal information for the end-entity
   certificate given in Appendix A.1, issued by the CA certificate given
   in Appendix A.2, using SHA256, the client would make the following
   request (the path has been split onto multiple lines for
   readability):

   GET https://example.com/acme/renewal-info/
           MFswCwYJYIZIAWUDBAIBBCCeWLRusNLb--vmWOkxm34qDjTMWkc
           3utIhOMoMwKDqbgQg2iiKWySZrD-6c88HMZ6vhIHZPamChLlzGH
           eZ7pTS8jYCCD6jRWhlRB8c

   The ACME Server MAY restrict the hash algorithms which it accepts
   (for example, only allowing SHA256 to limit the number of potential
   cache keys); if it receives a request whose embedded hashAlgorithm
   field contains an unacceptable OID, it SHOULD respond with HTTP
   status code 400 (Bad Request).

   The structure of an ACME renewalInfo resource is as follows:

   suggestedWindow (object, required): A JSON object with two keys,
   "start" and "end", whose values are timestamps, encoded in the format
   specified in [RFC3339], which bound the window of time in which the
   CA recommends renewing the certificate.

   explanationURL (string, optional): A URL pointing to a page which may
   explain why the suggested renewal window is what it is.  For example,
   it may be a page explaining the CA's dynamic load-balancing strategy,
   or a page documenting which certificates are affected by a mass
   revocation event.  Conforming clients SHOULD provide this URL to
   their operator, if present.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Retry-After: 21600

   {
     "suggestedWindow": {
       "start": "2021-01-03T00:00:00Z",
       "end": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z"
     },
     "explanationURL": "https://example.com/docs/example-mass-reissuance-event"
   }

   The server SHOULD include a Retry-After header indicating the polling
   interval that the ACME server recommends.  Conforming clients SHOULD
   query the renewalInfo URL again after the Retry-After period has
   passed, as the server may provide a different suggestedWindow.

   Conforming clients MUST attempt renewal at a time of their choosing
   based on the suggested renewal window.  The following algorithm is
   RECOMMENDED for choosing a renewal time:

   1.  Select a uniforn random time within the suggested window.

   2.  If the selected time is in the past, attempt renewal immediately.

   3.  Otherwise, if the client can schedule itself to attempt renewal
       at exactly the selected time, do so.

   4.  Otherwise, if the selected time is before the next time that the
       client would wake up normally, attempt renewal immediately.

   5.  Otherwise, sleep until the next normal wake time, re-check ARI,
       and return to Step 1.

   In all cases, renewal attempts are subject to the client's existing
   error backoff and retry intervals.

   In particular, cron-based clients may find they need to increase
   their run frequency to check ARI more frequently.  Those clients will
   need to store information about failures so that increasing their run
   frequency doesn't lead to retrying failures without proper backoff.
   Typical information stored should include: number of failures for a
   given order (defined by the set of names on the order), and time of
   the most recent failure.

   If the client receives no response or a malformed response (e.g. an
   end timestamp which precedes the start timestamp), it SHOULD make its
   own determination of when to renew the certificate, and MAY retry the
   renewalInfo request with appropriate exponential backoff behavior.

4.2.  Updating Renewal Information

   To update the renewal status of a certificate, the client sends a
   POST request to the server's renewalInfo URL.

   The body of the POST is a JWS object which is authenticated to an
   account as defined in [RFC8555], Section 6.2, and whose JSON payload
   has the following structure:

   certID (required, string): The CertID of the certificate whose
   renewal information should be updated, in the base64url-encoded
   version of the DER format with trailing "=" stripped.  Note: this is
   identical to the final path component constructed for GET requests
   above.

   replaced (required, boolean): Whether or not the client considers the
   certificate to have been replaced.  A certificate is considered
   replaced when its revocation would not disrupt any ongoing services,
   for instance because it has been renewed and the new certificate is
   in use, or because it is no longer in use.  Clients SHOULD NOT send a
   request where this value is false.

   POST /acme/renewal-info HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
       "nonce": "JHb54aT_KTXBWQOzGYkt9A",
       "url": "https://example.com/acme/renewal-info"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
       "certID": "MFswCwYJ...RWhlRB8c",
       "replaced": true
     }),
     "signature": "Q1bURgJoEslbD1c5...3pYdSMLio57mQNN4"
   }

   The server MUST verify that the request is signed by the account key
   of the Subscriber to which the certificate was originally issued.  If
   the server accepts the request and the update succeeds, it responds
   with HTTP status code 200 (OK).  If the update is rejected or fails,
   for example because the certificate has already been marked as
   replaced, the server returns an error.

   The server might use this renewal update to inform a number of
   processes, such as: not sending renewal reminder notifications for
   certificates that have been marked as replaced; sending empty or
   error responses to subsequent requests for the certificate's renewal
   information; or confidently revoking certificates subject to a mass
   revocation without fear of disrupting the Subscriber's operations.

5.  Security Considerations

   The extensions to the ACME protocol described in this document build
   upon the Security Considerations and threat model defined in
   [RFC8555], Section Section 10.1.

   This document specifies that renewalInfo resources MUST be exposed
   and accessed via unauthenticated GET requests, a departure from
   RFC8555's requirement that clients must send POST-as-GET requests to
   fetch resources from the server.  This is because the information
   contained in renewalInfo resources is not considered confidential,
   and because allowing renewalInfo to be easily cached is advantageous
   to shed load from clients which do not respect the Retry-After
   header.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Draft note: The following changes to IANA registries have not yet
   been made.

6.1.  New Registries

   Within the "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   Protocol" registry, IANA has created the new "ACME Renewal Info
   Object Fields" registry (Section 6.4).

6.2.  ACME Resource Type

   Within the "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   Protocol" registry, the following entry has been added to the "ACME
   Resource Types" registry.

           +=============+=====================+===============+
           | Field Name  | Resource Type       | Reference     |
           +=============+=====================+===============+
           | renewalInfo | Renewal Info object | This document |
           +-------------+---------------------+---------------+

                                  Table 2

6.3.  ACME Renewal Info Object Fields

   The "ACME Renewal Info Object Fields" registry lists field names that
   are defined for use in ACME renewal info objects.

   Template:

   *  Field name: The string to be used as a field name in the JSON
      object

   *  Field type: The type of value to be provided, e.g., string,
      boolean, array of string

   *  Reference: Where this field is defined

   Initial contents:

             +=================+============+===============+
             | Field Name      | Field type | Reference     |
             +=================+============+===============+
             | suggestedWindow | object     | This document |
             +-----------------+------------+---------------+
